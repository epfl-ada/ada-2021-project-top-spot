# Topic: Brexit, a story told by the news

### 1. Abstract:

Brexit was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The United Kingdom is the first and so far the only member state to have left the EU, after 47 years of having been a part of the union. It is an event that has made people very vocal and different opinions have been shared, particularly in the media. In this project, we want to put this event under the microscope and investigate several aspects of it. First, we want to do a descriptive analysis: When did we start mentioning Brexit, which words are used the most in our database, which are the main authors of the quotes, which media have relayed the information the most, which words were mostly searched on Google. 

### 2. Research Questions: 
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- When exactly and how did they start talking about Brexit? Who started? How did the speech change?
SPECIFIC: We focused on attitudes expressed by the news.
- By speakers (professions, sentiment)
- How many quotations are related to Brexit?
	- How does the number of quotations change over time/trend?  
	- Who are active speakers related to this topic?
	- What are the top reasons that they support or are against Brexit?
	- Opinions Pre and post-Brexit?
	- By news (attitudes: against or support)
- END: How some aspects ( economics, politics, science etc) changed with Brexit

### 3. Proposed additional datasets 

(To get additional attributes(topic, profession, country, gender, nationality..), we will be using Wikidata and/or Beautiful soup. We will use Wikidata for occurrences of research for the word BREXIT in Google. We also found an article: "Analyzing Brexitâ€™s impact using sentiment analysis and topic modeling on Twitter discussion" from Haider and al., we may need to use some of their analysis but they don't provide code.)
### 4. Methods 

* Sentimental analysis, Spectral Clustering, Word cloud 
* Spectral Clustering: speakers and to different subclasses professions, news' opinion, over time
* Word cloud of the sentiments and words used.
* LDA and Ngrams to identify the main topics discussed.
