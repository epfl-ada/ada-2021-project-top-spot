        "* To merge quotebank with the additional datasets, we have filtered those quotations related to Brexit by identifying possible keywords related to Brexit. We have already combined quotations with speaker attributes by joining with QIDs.  We also scrapped [the web page](https://icannwiki.org/Country_code_top-level_domain) to get the domain countries using beautiful soup for future analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* We then carried out a sentiment analysis, for that we used the results of three packages: Textblob, SentimentIntensityAnalyze and Flair. We have then taken the median of the three resulting polarities. To subsequently decide on the thresholds to choose for classifying the emotions (Positive, Negative, or Neutral), we manually labeled 100 quotes and selected the thresholds accordingly.  It is critical to note that the resulting emotion does not reflect the direct view or perception of the Brexit, i.e. pro or con. The resulting emotion is based on the tone of the quote. As an example (fabricated), the two quotes: \"Brexit is crucial, staying in the union would be a catastrophe, a suicide\" and \"Staying in the union is crucial, leaving would be a catastrophe, a suicide\" will both be assigned a negative emotion by design even though they stand for two different opinions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* We also performed an LDA topic modeling to get an insight about the most relevant subjects. This approach allowed us to notice clearly the different names involved with Brexit like Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, David Cameron etc..\n",

        "  Also, this analysis revealed some major keywords that allowed us to get some ideas about what was beeing discussed.\n",
        "\n",
        "   We can see that some of the speakers are projecting the Brexit as an opportunity for a better change, and some of them are reflecting all the risks that may accure, stating words like (risk, damage, lose, crisis, impact etc..).\n",
        "And also, we can see how some keywords are reflecting the will the stay in europe (partners, stay, deal, relationship, members etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "  But, this was not enough for us since we thout it would be more interesting to see the position of the most involved speakers with Brexit.\n",
        "\n",
        "  That's why we looked at the the most active ones and divided our research into 3 different timelines:\n",
        "  - just before the referendum (before 2016-06-20)\n",
        "  - period of referendum (from 2016-06-21 to 2016-06-25) \n",

We first encoded the category features-nationality, polarity, and occupation-using two methods: hot encoding and target encoding. We then used the T-SNE method to compress the features and generate tsne_x,tesn_y so that they could be plotted in 2D or 3D graphs. We obtained some plots and results, but we will leave the final interpretation and more advanced implementation of the T-SNE approach to be done as a future improvement of our T-SNE method.

We first notice that before 2015, only a few hundred citations were related to Brexit (only 0.5% of the Brexit data present in Quotebank). This switches in 2016 (9.28%) - the year when the Brexit was voted-  and we can see that until 2019, the number of citations will keep increasing until waiting for its peak reaching (39.51% of the total data). Yet in 2020, we witness a sharp drop. We suggest that this is because most news stories were relaying information about the coronavirus at that time. Another theory would be that the data was not completely extracted from year 2020. \n",

        " The red vertical lines correspond to the following important dates:\n",
        "  - *June 23, 2016* - The UK votes to leave in a referendum. The \"Leave\" camp, which favors the UK's exit from the EU, won with 51.9%, compared to 48.1% for the pro-EU \"Remain\" camp.\n",
        "  - *July 13, 2016* - Theresa May becomes Prime Minister following the resignation of David Cameroon. \n",
        "  - *March 29, 2017* - Warning: two-year countdown to the UK's exit from the European Union. The UK is then negotiating an exit agreement. \n",
        "  - *December 8, 2017* - Birth of the backstop: tensions form on Irish borders. In the event of an exit without an agreement of the United Kingdom from the EU, the 500 kilometers that separate the British province of Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland could become a physical border again. As London has decided to leave the single market and the customs union, which are synonymous with freedom of movement and common standards and customs duties, border controls will be necessary. However, this return to a border between the two countries would weaken the Good Friday Peace Agreement, which ended, in 1998, thirty years of armed conflict between nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland.\n",
        "  - *November 25, 2018*- After a period of calm, the subject of the Backstop resurfaces a second time. \n",
        "  - *June 24, 2019* - May takes a bow: Theresa May submits her resignation, following her failure to pass her plan to withdraw from the European Union.\n",
        "  - *July 24, 2019*- the Johnson era begins: Boris Johnson is elected leader of the Conservative Party the following year, he succeeds Theresa May as Prime Minister, promising a rapid exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.\n",
        "  - *28 August 2019*- Parliament put on ice for 5 weeks: In August, reports emerged that the new PM had asked the Queen to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to 31 October.\n",
        "  - *2 October 2019* - Johnson sets out his ‘reasonable compromise’ Brexit deal: By early October, the PM had made a formal proposal to the EU setting out his alternative to the Irish backstop. He claimed his plan was “entirely compatible with maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland”, unlike the “bridge to nowhere” backstop.\n",
        "  - *19 October 2019* - the showdown: Parliament hosted a special session for MPs on Saturday 19 October - less than two weeks before the Halloween Brexit deadline. It was the fifth time Parliament sat on a Saturday for 80 years, with the previous occasions including include the day before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Suez Crisis in 1956 and the Falklands War in 1982, says The Guardian. Johnson was legally obliged by the Benn Act to send a letter to the EU on that date requesting a three-month Brexit extension after Parliament refused to pass his deal.\n",
        "  - *31 January 2020* – departure day: Having won the majority he so desired in December, Johnson passes his withdrawal agreement, paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January.\n",
        "  - *16 October* – Johnson backs away: after multiple events, Johnson says the UK should “go for the Australia solution” as he announced that it’s time to “get ready\" for the prospect of no-deal Brexit.\n",
